"This program is about how to make a coffee machine."
"In this program we have created a dictionary having a key-value pair eg:- water, milk, etc. It also shows how much amount of resourses is required to make the particular drink and It returns 'true' if the resourses(water,milk,etc) are available else returns 'false'. This machine takes the money in 'quaters', 'dimes', 'nickles' and 'pennies' and returns 'true' if the money is sufficient and returns the change else returns 'false' and refund the money.
